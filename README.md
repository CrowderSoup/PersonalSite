# CrowderSoup.com

This is my personal site, hosted at [crowdersoup.com](http://crowdersoup.com).
It is hosted using Github Pages **for free**. Can't beat free!

This site uses:

- [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)
- [Hugo Mainroad Theme](https://github.com/Vimux/Mainroad)

I have Hugo configured to publish to the `docs` folder to allow me to host this
site out of a single repository. This way I can have the published content and
the source all in one place on Github. This makes publishing MUCH easier, as
all I have to do is run `hugo` and commit/push.
