      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at Angle Brackets. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I wanted to try taking all my notes in vim. I LOVE using vim. It&amp;rsquo;s a really awesome, powerful, and extendable command-line editor. I enjoy that it&amp;rsquo;s really distraction free. Being distracted is something that I struggle with so I really look for ways to stay focused.
I write in Markdown as well. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a simple, clean, well formatted plain text document that can be processed and produce HTML.</description>
