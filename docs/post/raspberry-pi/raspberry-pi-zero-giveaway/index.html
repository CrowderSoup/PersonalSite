    <h1 class="title">Raspberry Pi Zero Giveaway: Review</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching my local <a href="1" target="_blank">Barnes &amp; Nobel&rsquo;s</a> like a hawk the past few
weeks. In case you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, the official Raspberry Pi
magazine, <a href="2" target="_blank">MagPi</a>, shipped with the new <a href="3" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> attached to
the cover.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero, announced in late November of 2015, has been flying off
shelves as fast as it&rsquo;s stocked. They&rsquo;re HARD to get your hands on. I should
know, I&rsquo;ve been trying since they were first announced! I knew my best bet would
be to get a copy of the MagPi when it finally shipped to the States.</p>

<p>When first announced, lots of folks started buying up the stock of Zero&rsquo;s and
selling them at jacked-up prices. The Raspberry Pi foundation urged buyers not
to encourage price gougers, and to wait for more inventory. I decided to follow
this request as I felt that price gougers were going against the spirit of
the Pi itself. Computers should be evenly distributed at an affordable price to
all people.</p>

<p>However, I started to realize that the distribution of Zero&rsquo;s (and the MagPi)
were pretty uneven. Places that didn&rsquo;t need as much stock, got more than needed,
places that needed more didn&rsquo;t get enough. This led to people starting to buy
them for other folks, as well as giveaways to try and get these tiny computers
into as many hands as possible.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I posted in the <a href="4" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Subreddit</a> on Monday. I was FINALLY
able to get my hands on the coveted Issue #40 of the MagPi. Not only was I able
to get <strong>one</strong>, but due to the uneven distribution that I talked about, my local
Barnes &amp; Nobel had plenty of stock, and I was able to get a <strong>second</strong>. I
wanted to be able to give a Zero to someone who hasn&rsquo;t been able to find one
yet. Someone who would build something truly <em>awesome</em> with it.</p>

<p>Before I talk about the results of the giveaway, I want to talk about the
technology behind it. I decided to use a simple python script to automate
gathering contest entries from the Reddit Post. I could then, again with python,
select a random winner.</p>

<h3 id="the-code-5"><a href="5" target="_blank">The Code</a></h3>

<p>I put all the code up on Github so that no issues would arise with claims of
unfairness. I also wanted to write the code in such a way that I could
easily repurpose it for another giveaway in the future (by either myself or
anyone else willing to fork the repo).</p>

<p>I used <a href="6" target="_blank">PRAW</a> to gather the data from the Reddit Post. It was pretty trivial
to provide PRAW with a Submission ID and then loop over all the comments. Here&rsquo;s
what I did:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># We connect to Reddit using a Unique user_agent
r = praw.Reddit(user_agent='Reddit Raspberry Pi Giveaway (by /u/IrishLadd)')

# We get the submission, &quot;SUBMISSION&quot; here comes from a config file
submission = r.get_submission(submission_id=SUBMISSION)

# Let's make sure we get ALL comments in the thread:
submission.replace_more_comments(limit=None, threshold=0)

for comment in submission.comments:
    # Here I just did some checks to see if the comment matched, and that it's
    # author wasn't already on the list of entries.
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, the code for this really is pretty trivial. It does, as I said
before, remove any doubt that it was a fair contest. After getting all the
entries I then count the total number, and get a random <code>int</code> from 1 to that
number. This is the winning line!</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">entry_count = 0
with open(&quot;entries.csv&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as entries:
    entry_count = sum(1 for _ in entries) - 1

winning_entry_number = random.randint(1, entry_count)
winning_entry = linecache.getline('entries.csv', winning_entry_number)
winning_entry_parts = winning_entry.split(',')
winning_user = winning_entry_parts[0].strip(' &quot;\'\t\r\n')
winning_permalink = winning_entry_parts[1].strip(' &quot;\'\t\r\n')
</code></pre>

<p>So, without further adieu&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-winner">The Winner!</h3>

<p>The winner is <a href="http://reddit.com/u/nullandkale" target="_blank">/u/nullandkale</a>, with
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/40idxl/another_raspberry_pi_0_giveaway/cyushol" target="_blank">their entry</a>
of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would build either a controller to auto turn my computer off when I left the
house, or some sort of retropi handheld.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the script spitting out the results:</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who played!</p>
