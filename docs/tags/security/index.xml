      <title>Keybase Proof</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added my Keybase Proof as a text file at the root of this site. I used to have my site proven via DNS but for whatever reason CloudFlare removed my TXT record breaking the proof. I decided that having the .txt file proof was more resilient because even if I change hosting (Currently on Github Pages) my proof will remain intact.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t on Keybase check it out. I like to think of it as &amp;ldquo;crypto-as-a-service&amp;rdquo;.</description>
