      <title>GitHub Pages Over HTTPS</title>

      <description>Using HTTPS for your site has lots of benefits. Chief among them being security. Using HTTPS ensures that no one can intercept and read traffic between you and the site you&amp;rsquo;re visiting.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s traditionally been somewhat difficult and expensive to provide HTTPS for your sites visitors. Now though, with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt an SSL certificate is free! And if you&amp;rsquo;re using GitHub pages with a custom domain for hosting using it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier.</description>

      <title>Keybase Proof</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added my Keybase Proof as a text file at the root of this site. I used to have my site proven via DNS but for whatever reason CloudFlare removed my TXT record breaking the proof. I decided that having the .txt file proof was more resilient because even if I change hosting (Currently on Github Pages) my proof will remain intact.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t on Keybase check it out. I like to think of it as &amp;ldquo;crypto-as-a-service&amp;rdquo;.</description>
