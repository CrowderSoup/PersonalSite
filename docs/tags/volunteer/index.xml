      <description>Yesterday I took part in the Hour of Code at my local high school as a volunteer.In fact, it was at the high school that I attended. I had a lot of fun and I was excited to see the stundents gain a deeper understanding of code.
I was especially impressed with the number of young women in the class that seemed to really enjoy it. It&amp;rsquo;s a really common misunderstanding that people hold that girls aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in tech.</description>
