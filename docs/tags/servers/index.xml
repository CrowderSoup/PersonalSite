      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of setting up Mastodon on my own server for a while now. Today I finally got around to actually doing it (after a failed attempt a couple months ago). I found a guide that I loosely referred to and was immensely helpful at a couple points.
At first I tried running on a super small $5 instance, which seemed fine during setup, but died every few requests when I started using it.</description>
