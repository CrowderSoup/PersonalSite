      <description>It seems like the &amp;ldquo;thing to do&amp;rdquo; at the beginning of each new year is to make New Years Resolutions. If you&amp;rsquo;re at all into blogging then you know that you then have to publish those resolutions for all the people who don&amp;rsquo;t read your blog to see. That&amp;rsquo;s who/what this post is for.
I wanted to make my resolutions less about &amp;ldquo;I want to lose weight&amp;rdquo;, and more focused on programming, open source, and this blog.</description>
