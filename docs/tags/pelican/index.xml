      <description>Last night I got the wild hare to migrate my personal site from Pelican to Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do it for a while now, so to give myself the push I needed to get it done I deleted my old personal site from Github.
Differences Front Matter Honestly the biggest different for content is &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo;. Both Hugo and Pelican, as static site generators, use front matter to describe pieces of content.</description>

      <description>I recently started using Pelican static site generator for this blog. I was drawn to it for a few reasons:
 It uses Jinja2 for templates, which I love. It written in python It reminds me a lot of Flask (this might be because of using Jinja2&amp;hellip;)  I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few interesting things with this site though. I&amp;rsquo;m hosting the repo that contains the source content, configuration, etc. on Gitlab.</description>
