      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Christmas was one for the books. As a father it was SO much fun to watch my two girls have the time of their little lives getting and playing with all their new toys. Their excitement and wonderment meant the world to me, even if I know they don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand everything.
Before we went down, we had the girls get their Christmas Jamies on!
When we went downstairs there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much ceremony to it at all.</description>
