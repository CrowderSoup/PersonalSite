      <description>This site has had a couple new themes lately, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally settled on one: Basics Plus. This is actually a theme that I&amp;rsquo;ve forked from Basics. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly simple and paired down theme. I forked it so that I could change a couple things:
 The top menu (more dynamic, able to add more items) Add Disqus comments The byline  These are some fairly small feature changes. I plan to make more changes / refinements going forward while keeping the clean / simple look and feel.</description>

      <description>I recently started using Pelican static site generator for this blog. I was drawn to it for a few reasons:
 It uses Jinja2 for templates, which I love. It written in python It reminds me a lot of Flask (this might be because of using Jinja2&amp;hellip;)  I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few interesting things with this site though. I&amp;rsquo;m hosting the repo that contains the source content, configuration, etc. on Gitlab.</description>
