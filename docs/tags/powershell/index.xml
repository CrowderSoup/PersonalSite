      <description>Yesterday I learned a neat trick with Visual Studio Code when working on some PowerShell scripts to help orchestrate build and deployment of our projects (more on that in a different post). I knew that VSCode had a debugger, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a debugger for PowerShell had been added via an extension.
I had installed this extension some time ago to help with writing PowerShell scripts in VSCode, but I was running my PowerShell prompt in another window to actually test them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at Angle Brackets. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I wanted to try taking all my notes in vim. I LOVE using vim. It&amp;rsquo;s a really awesome, powerful, and extendable command-line editor. I enjoy that it&amp;rsquo;s really distraction free. Being distracted is something that I struggle with so I really look for ways to stay focused.
I write in Markdown as well. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a simple, clean, well formatted plain text document that can be processed and produce HTML.</description>
