      <title>Using Husky to Build Hugo Site</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making some efforts to streamline the publishing process for this site. I&amp;rsquo;ve read about tools like Netlify and Lektor, but I wanted to keep things as close to a basic Hugo site as possible.
To that end, I wanted to use git hooks to run hugo whenever I ran git commit. That way to publish a new post I simply had to write it in markdown, save, commit and push.</description>

      <description>Last night I got the wild hare to migrate my personal site from Pelican to Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do it for a while now, so to give myself the push I needed to get it done I deleted my old personal site from Github.
Differences Front Matter Honestly the biggest different for content is &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo;. Both Hugo and Pelican, as static site generators, use front matter to describe pieces of content.</description>
