      <description>Last night I got the wild hare to migrate my personal site from Pelican to Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do it for a while now, so to give myself the push I needed to get it done I deleted my old personal site from Github.
Differences Front Matter Honestly the biggest different for content is &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo;. Both Hugo and Pelican, as static site generators, use front matter to describe pieces of content.</description>

      <description>A couple months ago I decided I needed to be better about telling my wonderful wife how much I loved her on a daily basis. Being the nerd that I am I decided to tackle this using IFTTT and a custom web app. For this project I went with Django to build my app out. I&amp;rsquo;d never used it before so I wanted a chance to play with it.</description>
