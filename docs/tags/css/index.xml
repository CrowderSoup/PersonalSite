      <description>I often have need to build layout&amp;rsquo;s that vary depending on the content put in them. I can&amp;rsquo;t always count on that content being the same (cough CMSs cough). It&amp;rsquo;s just one of those things you have to do.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;m having to do a lot though, is making the body of a page take up a certain amount of space so that the footer doesn&amp;rsquo;t look weird. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve used JavaScript to make the footer take up the remaining space on the page if the content didn&amp;rsquo;t take up enough.</description>
