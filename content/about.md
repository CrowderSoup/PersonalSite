I'm Aaron Crowder. I'm a Software Developer and lover of the web. I'm also
a husband and father, and that job will always come first in my life.

## Work
I'm currently doing my 9-5 at [InsideSales.com](https://insidesales.com). I'm
building microservices using NodeJS, and dabbling in front-end using
React/Redux. I really enjoy my day-to-day and I'm not currently looking for new
opportunities. That said, if you have something you really think will pique my
interest feel free to reach out!
