Using HTTPS for your site has lots of benefits. Chief among them being
security. Using HTTPS ensures that no one can intercept and read traffic
between you and the site you're visiting.

However, it's traditionally been somewhat difficult and expensive to provide
HTTPS for your sites visitors. Now though, with [Let's Encrypt][1] an SSL
certificate is free! And if you're using GitHub pages with a custom domain for
hosting using it couldn't be easier.
