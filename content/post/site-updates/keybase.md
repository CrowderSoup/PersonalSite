I've added my [Keybase Proof][1] as a text file at the root of this site.
I used to have my site proven via DNS but for whatever reason CloudFlare
removed my TXT record breaking the proof. I decided that having the .txt file
proof was more resilient because even if I change hosting (Currently on Github
Pages) my proof will remain intact.

If you aren't on [Keybase][2] check it out. I like to think of it as
"crypto-as-a-service". They have the ability to share files or have chats (team
or one-on-one) that are encrypted end-to-end.
