This site has had a couple new themes lately, but I've finally settled on one:
[Basics Plus][1]. This is actually a theme that I've forked from [Basics][2].
It's a fairly simple and paired down theme. I forked it so that I could change
a couple things:

1. The top menu (more dynamic, able to add more items)
2. Add Disqus comments
3. The byline

These are some fairly small feature changes. I plan to make more changes
/ refinements going forward while keeping the clean / simple look and feel.
