It seems like the "thing to do" at the beginning of each new year is to make
New Years Resolutions. If you're at all into blogging then you know that you
then have to publish those resolutions for all the people who don't read your
blog to see. That's who/what this post is for.

I wanted to make my resolutions less about "I want to lose weight", and more
focused on programming, open source, and this blog.

<small>Some motivation from shia</small>

### 1. Blog (at least) Weekly
I am here, before the world, committing to writing in this blog at least once a
week.

### 2. Spend (at least) 5 hours a week working on Open Source Software
Whether it's my own projects or someone else's I want to spend more time each
week working on OSS.

### 3. Read 1 book per quarter
I'll probably focus on books related to programming, software, or technology in
general. However, if a work of fiction slips in one quarter I'll count it.

### 4. Learn a new programming language
I'd like to learn something like Go, but I'm not yet decided. Ruby wouldn't be
bad, neither would Java.

With these goals in mind, you'll be seeing a lot more of me on this blog. So, to
my one and only reader, [Kenz](http://interiorsbykenz.com) (my wife), here's to
a great year ahead!
