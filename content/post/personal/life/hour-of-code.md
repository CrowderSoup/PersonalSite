Yesterday I took part in the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) at my
local high school as a volunteer.In fact, it was at the high school that **I**
attended. I had a lot of fun and I was excited to see the stundents gain a
deeper understanding of code.

I was especially impressed with the number of young women in the class that
seemed to really enjoy it. It's a really common misunderstanding that people hold
that girls aren't interested in tech. I think in too many cases they are steered
in other directions, towards things they *should* be interested in. I'm glad to
have been able to give **all** the kids an opportunity to see if programming is
a career they'd be interested in.

We did the [Star Wars](https://code.org/api/hour/begin/starwars) tutorial on
Code.org (because duh, Star Wars). After a brief introduction from me I turned
them lose and walked around the room answering questions. I think that was my
favorite part; hearing the questions from the kids.

I think the most common question I was asked was this:

> How do I make my game end when they get to a certain number of points?

It showed that they were thinking about a specific problem and going about it
logically. They just needed a little help getting the code right since the Code.org
workspace didn't have a built-in way to do that. The solution I helped the kids
implement was this (this is, of course, mostly psedo code:

```
var points = 0;
var pointsToWin = 500;

function whenAddPoints(points) {
    points += points;

    if(points >= pointsToWin) {
        endGame("win");
    }
}
```

I was able to compile a list of links to all their games. In the interest of
privacy I'm not going to share any names here, but here's the links to their games!
